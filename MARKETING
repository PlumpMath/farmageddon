"Hi James,

I've been following your blog for a little while as I'm a big Gambit
user and saw your plea for marketing help for your iphone game.

I have a website http://www.web-adventures.org which is gaming related
that gets a little traffic and I make a few hundred $ a year from in
advertising.

I'd be quite happy to place a text or graphic ad on there for you for
free to help you get started. I might want to take it off at some
point to make room for paid advertising. Anyway if you send me a
suitable graphic (animated gif around 200x200 is probably best) and
the link where you want it to go, I'll happily put it on."
