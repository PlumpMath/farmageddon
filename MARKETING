Farmageddon is an OpenFeint-enabled game where animals have gone insane. They have turned against humans and fling themselves towards you, and you must be the one to stop them with your power of lightning before they destroy you (and crack your precious iPhone's screens)!

Chickens, ducks, sheeps, pigs, and cows are all part of the fight. Pigs and cows are especially dangerous because of their large, heavy bodies which explode into pieces that still hurt you.

Humans sometimes get caught in the fray; be sure not to kill them or you will lose instantly! Other twists to the fight are nukes, which appear as green radioactive animals and destroy all animals on the screen, and meat and bones which when shot heal you.

Try to get the highest score by staying alive the longest and killing the most animals!

Reviews:

"This is really fun and pretty challenging.  Playing it on an iPad is working great too - it's extremely gratifying to strum your finger across the screen and take down a front of ducks" - snowyote

"I'm really enjoying it, pretty addicting." - petabread9
